The food dish that ChatGPT created with p5 and basic shapes had a lot of interesting similarities and differences to the one I created.
We both created pizza, and both used the basic light brownish for crust, and yellow for cheese, but there were still several differences as well.
I created an entire round pizza where ChatGPT created a single slice. My shapes were more random and experimental, such as using an extra thick
line for my base, and randomly shaped polygons for pineapple slices, whereas ChatGPT used simple triangles, circles, and ellipses. I tried
to use vibrant colors and solid shapes, where ChatGPT used duller colors, and left the dark black outline on each shape.
